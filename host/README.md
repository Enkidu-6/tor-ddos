# Files to be run on the host

If you run multiple VMs and you'd like to manage the IPtables for all VMs on the host server, you can use these scripts. By specifying the IP addresses of individual
VMs, you can have multiple rules, each dealing with a specific VM. These scripts are a bit more complicated and harder to manage. They are here for reference and to give
users another option. I recommend using the main scripts on each individual VM separately.
